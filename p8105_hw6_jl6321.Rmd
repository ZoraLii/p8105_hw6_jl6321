```

## Problem 2

Read in and manipulate the data: 
```{r}
homicide = read_csv("./data/homicide-data.csv") %>% 
  unite(col = "city_state", city:state, sep = ", ", remove = FALSE) %>% 
  mutate(ifsolved = ifelse(disposition == "Closed by arrest", 1, 0), 
         victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age)) %>% 
  filter(!(city_state %in% c("Dallas, TX", "Phoenix, AZ", "Kansas City, MO", "Tulsa, AL"))) %>% 
  filter(victim_race %in% c("White", "Black")) 
```


```{r}
baltimore = 
  homicide %>% 
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD") 

baltimore_model = 
  baltimore %>% 
  glm(ifsolved ~ victim_age + victim_sex + victim_race, data = ., family = binomial())

```
